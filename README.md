Built from design spec! No given code, all my HTML and CSS!

Built from this ^ and image links. (Not mentioned but seeable that all text is Helvetica.)

I noticed they didn't bold the h2 and prices like in the design spec. I checked their html and css to double check my work and found I used <strong> instead of <span class="price">, I used semenatic HTML, and used "h2" selector instead of ".item h2". I'm okay with my differences, a larger project would like the span and more specific selector.
